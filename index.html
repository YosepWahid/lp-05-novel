            <h4>sinopsis</h4>
            <dd>
                When I opened my eyes, I was inside a novel.
                <br>
                [The Birth of a Hero].
                <br>
                [The Birth of a Hero] was a novel focused on the adventures of the main character, Choi Han, a high school boy who was transported to a different dimension from Earth, along with the birth of the numerous heroes of the continent.
                <br>
                I became a part of that novel as the tr*sh of the Count’s family, the family that oversaw the territory where the first village that Choi Han visits is located.
                <br>
                The problem is that Choi Han becomes twisted after that village, and everyone in it, is destroyed by assassins.
                <br>
                The bigger problem is the fact that this s*upid tr*sh who I’ve become doesn’t know about what happened in the village and messes with Choi Han, only to get beaten to a pulp.
                <br>
                “…This is going to be a problem.”
                <br>
                I feel like something serious has happened to me.
                <br>
                But it was worth trying to make this my new life.
